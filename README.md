## Description 
This is a simple macos application for bundling externally built binaries to another macOS app.

✅ Combines two binaries with different architectures to a single binary using lipo, if necessary
✅ Codesigns the binary so that can be bundled into a macOS application and inherit all the sandbox permissions

Follows these instructions: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/embedding-a-helper-tool-in-a-sandboxed-app#Embed-an-externally-built-tool
